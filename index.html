                        <p>This midcentury beauty practically jumped off the pages of Joys of Jell-O, a fun little booklet of jello recipes published by General Foods Corporation in 1967. I originally set out to find a recipe that actually sounds edible, but I can rarely resist the allure of an off-putting salad. I donâ€™t want to live in a Cauliflower Radish Jello-free world knowing that such a thing exists.</p>

                        <p>This crockpot mac and cheese is creamy, comforting, and takes just moments to assemble in a slow cooker. Great for large family gatherings and to take to potluck dinners. It's always a big hit!</p>
