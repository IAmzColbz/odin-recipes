    <h1>Cauliflower Radish Salad</h1>

    <img src="https://moldedmemories.food.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/img_8913_vsco.jpg?w=863" alt="A terrible concoction of demise (Veggie Jello Salad)" width="256">

    <h4>This midcentury beauty practically jumped off the pages of Joys of Jell-O, a fun little booklet of jello recipes published by General Foods Corporation in 1967. I originally set out to find a recipe that actually sounds edible, but I can rarely resist the allure of an off-putting salad. I don’t want to live in a Cauliflower Radish Jello-free world knowing that such a thing exists.</h4>
    <p><strong>Prep Time: </strong>Hell || <strong>Cook Time: </strong>If I || <strong>Servings: </strong>Know?</p>
    <br>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Package Lemon Jell-O</li>
        <li>1/2 tps. Salt</li>
        <li>1 Cup Boiling Water</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup Cold Water</li>
        <li>1 Cup Diced Radishes</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup Chopped Raw Cauliflower</li>
        <li>4 tsp. Vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Grated Onion</li>
        <li>(Optional) Taste buds</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3><strong>Preparation Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the gelatin and salt. Boil a cup of water and add the gelatin/salt, stirring until completely dissolved. Add the cold water and stir. </li>
        <li>You may chill it in the fridge, but my preferred method is to put the pot in a cake pan filled with ice and some cold water. I do this to chill it really fast, but also because my fridge is small. It’s at about this point in one of my food adventures that I discover that I made a jello with nowhere to put it, so I need tabletop chilling time to throw away forgotten leftovers.</li>
        <li>While the jello is chilling, combine chopped cauliflower and radishes with the vinegar and grated onion. You can chop these as fine as you would like, but if you ever decide to actually make and eat this, I recommend chopping them small so you don’t end up with big crunchy chunks of vegetables. Let the vegetables marinate in the vinegar for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>If you’ve been chilling your jello on ice, 20-30 minutes should be enough time for the gelatin to thicken almost to the point of setting, but still nice and goopy. Do not let it set completely because the last thing you want to do is turn this into a whipped savory jello. </li>
        <li>Fold in your vegetables and pour into individual molds. You could use a big mold, but little molds are definitely the way to go here. Let your jello set four hours or overnight. </li>
        <li>Unmold and serve! The recipe suggests unmolding on lettuce, which I didn’t do because I had none. To make this as 1960s-americana as possible, use terrible lettuce like iceburg.</li>
        <li>Immediately after eating, purge your stomach at your earliest convenience. I forgot to do this the last time I ate it and had debilitating food poisoning for weeks!</li>
